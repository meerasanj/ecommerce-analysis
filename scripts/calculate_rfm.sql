# Execution 

# 1. Run SQL query using DuckDB and convert the result to a Pandas DataFrame.
rfm_df = duckdb.query(query).to_df()

# 2. Save resulting DataFrame to new CSV file in the data/processed/ folder.
# note: `index=False` prevents pandas from writing row indices into the file
rfm_df.to_csv('data/processed/rfm_data.csv', index=False)

# 3. Print confirmation message to console indicating successful completion.
print("âœ… RFM data exported to data/processed/rfm_data.csv")
